Corral is an MIT licensed multi-agent orchestration application for managing AI coding agents across git worktrees running locally on your local or remote machine. The application is built using tmux and FastAPI for easy extensibilty and modification. It is designed with the hope that we can back some sanity to coding with AI agents across multiple worktrees and sessions. The automated goals and status for each session are displayed prominantly, you can do full text search across previous sessions and resume them. The activity of the agent is visible so you can follow along and start to get a better understanding of just what these things are doing. We welcome feedback, commits and hope it brings you some stress releif to corral those little AIs.

## Features

- **Multi-agent support** — Launch and manage both Claude and Gemini agents side-by-side across worktrees
- **Web dashboard** — Real-time monitoring with pane capture, status tracking, and command input
- **Session history** — Browse past sessions from both Claude and Gemini
- **Full-text search** — Search across all session content 
- **Auto-summarization** — Summarization of sessions are stored for text search later
- **Session notes & activity** — Add markdown notes and see the activty that occured in each seassion live and historically
- **Remote control** — Send commands, navigate modes, and manage agents from the dashboard
- **Attach/Kill/Restart/Resume** — Open a terminal attached to any agent's tmux session, or kill it directly from the UI, or relaunch as a neew session
- **Git integration & PR Linking** Tracks, commits, and remote URL per agent & session

## Installation

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install agent-corral
```

Or install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/cdknorow/corral.git
```

## Launch agents and web dashboard

You can launch the web server directly using `corral` or `corral-dashboard`:

```bash
# Start the web dashboard directly (default: http://localhost:8420)
corral

# Custom host/port
corral --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9000

```

> **Note:** This system is currently mostly tested with Claude Code and to some extent Gemini CLI. However, the underlying architecture is extensible to any cli based agents.

### Session history search and filtering

![history](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3848aefe-e358-425b-ae14-ed2f41704a33)


The sidebar History section includes a search bar and filters for browsing your entire AI coding session history along with activity, notes, and git commit tracking

On startup, the server launches three background services:

1. **Session indexer** (every 2 min) — Indexes all Claude sessions from `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` and Gemini sessions from `~/.gemini/tmp/*/chats/session-*.json`, builds a full-text search index (FTS5), and queues new sessions for auto-summarization
2. **Batch summarizer** — Continuously processes the summarization queue using Claude CLI
3. **Git poller** (every 2 min) — Polls git branch, commit, and remote URL for each live agent and stores snapshots in SQLite

Features:

- **Search** — Type in the search bar to find sessions by content (uses SQLite FTS5 with porter stemming)
- **Filter by tag** — Select a tag from the dropdown to narrow results
- **Filter by source** — Show only Claude or Gemini sessions
- **Pagination** — Browse through all sessions with prev/next controls
- **URL bookmarking** — Session URLs use hash routing (`#session/<id>`) so you can bookmark or share links
- **Notes & tags** — Add markdown notes and color-coded tags to any session, stored in `~/.corral/sessions.db`


### Managing sessions from the dashboard

<img width="1502" height="812" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a8d1b7b-1bef-414b-9002-c27dd928342b" />


The web dashboard provides quick-action buttons for each live session:

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Esc / Arrow / Enter** | Send navigation keys to the agent |
| **Plan Mode** | Toggle Claude Code plan mode |
| **Accept Edits** | Toggle Claude Code auto-accept mode |
| **Bash Mode** | Send `!` command to enter bash mode |
| **Base Mode** | Toggle base mode |
| **/compact / /clear** | Send compress or clear commands (adapts per agent type) |
| **Reset** | Compress then clear the session |
| **Attach** | Open a local terminal window attached to the agent's tmux session |
| **Restart** | Restart the agent in the same tmux pane |
| **Kill** | Terminate the tmux session and remove it from the dashboard |

You can also type arbitrary commands in the input bar and send them to the selected agent.



### Claude Code Hooks (settings.json)

To fully integrate Claude Code's agentic state and task management into the Corral dashboard, configure the provided `corral-hook` scripts in your Claude Code `settings.json` (usually located at `~/.claude.json` or `~/.claude/settings.json`).

If you are already using other configuration options like a custom `statusLine` or other hooks, simply merge these hook definitions into your existing JSON:

```json
"hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "TaskCreate|TaskUpdate",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "corral-hook-task-sync"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "corral-hook-agentic-state"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "corral-hook-agentic-state"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "corral-hook-agentic-state"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

```



Or use launcher which discovers worktree subdirectories, creates a agent for each one, and starts launches the dashboard:

```bash
# Launch Claude agents and web dashboard for worktrees in the current directory
launch-corral

# Launch Gemini agents from a specific path
launch-corral <path-to-root> gemini

```

### Remote server development (SSH port forwarding)

If you're running Corral on a remote server, forward the dashboard port over SSH to access it in your local browser:

```bash
# Forward remote port 8420 to localhost:8420
ssh -L 8420:localhost:8420 user@remote-host

# If using a custom port
ssh -L 9000:localhost:9000 user@remote-host
```

Then open `http://localhost:8420` (or your custom port) in your local browser. You can add this to your `~/.ssh/config` to make it persistent:

```
Host my-dev-server
    HostName remote-host
    User user
    LocalForward 8420 localhost:8420
```

### Manual tmux management

```bash
# Attach to a specific agent session
tmux attach -t claude-agent-1

# Switch between windows
Ctrl+b n  # next
Ctrl+b p  # previous

# Detach from tmux
Ctrl+b d
```

## Agent Protocol

Agents emit structured markers using the `||PULSE:<EVENT_TYPE> <payload>||` format. The dashboard parses these from agent output in real time:

```
||PULSE:STATUS <Short description of current task>||
||PULSE:SUMMARY <One-sentence high-level goal>||
||PULSE:CONFIDENCE <1-5> <short reason>||
```

The protocol is automatically injected via `PROTOCOL.md` when launching agents. See [`src/corral/PROTOCOL.md`](src/corral/PROTOCOL.md) for the full specification.
